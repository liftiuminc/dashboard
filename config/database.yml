# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3-ruby (not necessary on OS X Leopard)
#
# sqlite can be used... but ran into the following problems:
# 1) Odd behavior with composite foreign keys when running tests
# SQLite3::SQLException: object name reserved for internal use: sqlite_autoindex_fills_day_1: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "sqlite_autoindex_fills_day_1" ON "fills_day" ("tag_id", "day")
# Patch for CORE here: http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/4537
# 2) mysql says rand(), sqlite says random()
# 3) Boolean values handled inconsistently. sqllite does "t" and "f", mysql does 1/0
